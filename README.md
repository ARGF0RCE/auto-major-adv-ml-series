## 🔧 Foundation Project: Warranty Cost Repair Prediction

### Project Overview

The course begins with a comprehensive warranty cost prediction project for Volkswagen vehicles in the Indian market, establishing the practical foundation for all advanced techniques covered throughout the series.

### 📊 Dataset Characteristics

**Synthetic Dataset Features:**
- **25,000 vehicle records** with complete warranty information
- **India-specific environmental factors**: Monsoon exposure, air pollution, dust levels
- **Comprehensive vehicle data**: Make, model, engine type, transmission, usage patterns
- **Regional variations**: Six major Indian regions with distinct characteristics
- **Component failure risks**: Engine, transmission, electrical, suspension, brake, AC systems
- **Target variables**: Repair costs (INR), claim counts, high-cost claim flags

**Key Business Metrics:**
- Average repair cost: ₹57,819
- High-cost claims (>₹75K): 22.8% of total claims
- Top 5% of claims account for 30.9% of total warranty costs
- Environmental severity impact: 1.4x cost difference between high/low severity regions
